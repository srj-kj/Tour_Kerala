              Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the 108 Divyadesams of Lord Vishnu and 
              \among the most sacred places of pilgrimage in Kerala. Although the origin of this temple remains a mystery, 
              devotees believe it to have existed since the first day of the Kali Yuga, which was 5000 years ago. 
              The Padmanabhaswamy temple also has a mention in the Bhagwad Gita. The scripture states that Balarama, 
              the older brother of Lord Krishna frequented the temple, 
              bathed in the Padmatheertham, and also made several offerings to the deity here.

Kovalam means 'A grove of coconut trees and the whole area beyond the shores around Kovalam is filled with the endless sight of coconut trees offering magnificent views while approaching the beach. Kovalam gained importance when Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Travancore, built a palace, the Halcyon Castle on the top of a rock near the beach in the 1930s.
              Thereafter the place was brought to the public eye by her nephew the Maharaja of Travancore.
