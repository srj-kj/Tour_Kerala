              There is a deer park inside the sanctuary. Adjacent to the deer park, the Taxidermic Museum showcases the 
              natives of the region. The entrance to the sanctuary lies across the bridge at Thattekkad. There are several 
              trekking trails inside Salim Ali Bird Trail, Black Baza Trail, and Trogon Trail. A walk through the interior of the woods will be a great experience and it also helps you in spotting and identifying those birds, which otherwise for the untrained eyes of a traveller, remain invisible. 
              The guides can be hired at Assistant Wildlife Office near the entrance gate.
